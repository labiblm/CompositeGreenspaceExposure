library(spdep)
library(spatialreg)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
CompositeLSOA <- read_sf(dsn = ".", layer = "CompositefulldataF")
plot(CompositeLSOA)

YPLL <- CompositeLSOA$Yrpotlife
CompositeLSOA$YPLL <- YPLL
summary (CompositeLSOA$Yrpotlife)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
